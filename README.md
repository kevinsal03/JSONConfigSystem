# JSONConfigSystem
A very not good configuration system that uses JSON.  
**You probably should not be using this.**  

### Goals
* Be easy to use.
* Work simply with Bukkit-esque plugin systems.
* Use JSON instead of the traditional YAML because I like JSON and the built-in YAML system kinda sucks.
* Be as flexible as possible.

Google GSON is used to parse the JSON, and is required to actually do anything with it. This just manages the files and gets the objects.  
*This will probably be rewritten to be actually useful in the future, but until then this works.*
